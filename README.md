Echo is a telegram redirect service for redirecting and manipulating telegram
messages

## Sui Generis Branches

The branch `mateus_api_client` was made specific for treating multiple GD groups
from Mateus Ara√∫jo' Telgram API. As needed, more sui generis branches can be
created to fulfill specific needs.

## Duplicate Key Error

In order to avoid this duplicated key error, if you want to run two Echo
instances simultaneously, you need to delete session files from the branch and
then run again.
